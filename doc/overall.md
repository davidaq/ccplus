CCPlus Overall
==============

CCPlus is an engine for defining and rendering video compositions. The motivation of this project is to implement a video rendering engine that will work on mobile devices (android and iOS system to be specific) and a lightweight alternative for Adobe After Effects render engine.

This engine will be used on mobile device to generate preview quality videos and final quality on servers. Another project will be found to provide distributed video render service using this engine.
